# TCA Migration Plan

This folder breaks the SwiftUI-to-TCA migration into small, ordered tasks so we can refactor the app one piece at a time without destabilizing the current codebase.

## Progress

- Phase 1, `01-setup-tca.md`, is done.
- Phase 2, `02-app-shell-navigation.md`, is done.
- Phase 3, `03-home-feature.md`, is done.
- The app now has a TCA foundation layer, a root `AppFeature`, a TCA shell navigation stack, and a real reducer-backed Home feature.
- The next phases are feature-by-feature migration for Search, Detail, and Player.

## Migration Rules

- Work on a dedicated branch before making architectural changes.
- Migrate one feature at a time.
- Keep existing repository, storage, and Supabase layers intact during the first pass.
- Add reducer tests before removing the old MVVM code for each feature.
- Prefer small commits so each checkpoint is easy to review and revert if needed.
- Mark each completed phase in its own file before moving on.
- Keep a companion result note for each completed phase so future readers can understand the why, not just the checklist.
