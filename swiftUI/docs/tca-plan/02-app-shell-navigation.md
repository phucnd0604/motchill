# Task 2: Move App Shell and Navigation to TCA

## Status

Done.

The shell now uses TCA tree-based navigation with placeholder feature reducers, while the legacy MVVM screens remain in the repo for later phases.

## Goal

Replace the custom router with TCA-driven app state and navigation.

## What Was Implemented

1. Root shell state now owns a `StackState`-backed navigation path.
2. The shell presents `HomeFeature`, `SearchFeature`, `DetailFeature`, and `PlayerFeature` as placeholder reducers instead of forwarding to the old router.
3. Auth sheet presentation moved into TCA presentation state with `@Presents`.
4. `AuthFeature` became a standalone reducer and `AuthView` now binds directly to the store.
5. `onOpenURL` now flows through `AppFeature` so the shell can react through reducer logic.
6. The dependency bridge uses TCA dependency clients, not SwiftUI environment injection.
7. The legacy `AppRouter` and MVVM screens were kept intact for later phases, but the shell no longer depends on them as the source of truth.

## Test Plan

- Reducer tests cover:
  - push search route
  - push detail route
  - push player route
  - pop route
  - pop-to-root
  - present and dismiss auth sheet
  - handle auth callback URL
- Shell smoke coverage confirms the root still launches and reaches the placeholder feature flow.

## Acceptance Criteria

- App navigation is controlled by TCA state.
- `AppRouter` is no longer the shell source of truth.
- Search/detail/player are reachable through the TCA navigation stack.
- Auth banner and auth sheet are driven by reducer state.
